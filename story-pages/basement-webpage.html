            The stairs creak ominously as you descend into the basement. It's pitch black, but you're able to find make out and pull a cord attached to a pendant lightbulb, although the light doesn't provide much help. The air is damp and suffocating, filled with the musty scent of neglect. You can see  you can't help but notice an amalgamation of coackroaches and spiders skittering around the floor.

            The basement is a cluttered labyrinth of old furniture, cardboard boxes, and forgotten tools. The walls are lined with shelves that hold a disorganized collection of rusted metal and dusty jars. Water drips from the ceiling, forming small puddles on the concrete floor. The darkness feels alive, closing in on you with every hesitant step you take deeper into the space.

            As you step towards the breaker you feel a familiar ungodly presence. There's something with you in the darkness.
