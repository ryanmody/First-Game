                    Your breathing is ragged, and the room feels colder now. The nightmare, the creature, the dread... it's finally over. You've managed to survive this seemingly never-ending purgatory.

                   Something catches your eye. In her hand, tightly clutched, is a crumpled parchment. Trembling fingers retrieve it, unfolding the paper to reveal her delicate script, addressed to him.

                        I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the fight we had, for the pain I caused you. I don't know how I'll ever forgive myself for what happened to your face. I'll never be able to forgive myself for what I did.

                        I know things haven't been easy since you came back. The distance between us feels like an ocean sometimes. I can't imagine the horrors you must have faced, the things that haunt your dreams and take away your peace.

                        But despite it all, I still believe in us. I believe we can make it through this, no matter how hard it gets. We've faced challenges before, and we've come out stronger. And I know deep down, you're still the man I married. I don't care how long it takes, but I'll do everything in my power to bring him back.

                        <p class="letter">I'll wait for you, forever if I have to.  I want that future with you, for us. I was waiting to tell you the news, but maybe it'll be good to share it now, as a beacon for all the good things coming our way.</p>

                        <p class="letter">Please, find your way back to me. I'll always be by your side, holding onto the promise of better days ahead.</p>

                        <p class="letter"> Yours forever,

                        Em.

                    Folded neatly at the bottom of the letter is a smaller picture, a sonogram. In the grayscale image, a tiny form is visible - a new life. Underneath, written in delicate script, is the name "David."
