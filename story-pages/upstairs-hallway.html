            You climb the stairs, each step echoing ominously. The hallway is lined with family photos, their faces blurred and indistinct. There's a bathroom door ajar, revealing a dual set of toothbrushes and toiletries. The realization that this house belongs to two people hits you hard.

        <p class="second-paragraphs">
            The wooden floorboards creak under your weight, and the faded wallpaper is marked with stains and scratches. The photos on the wall, though their details are obscured, evoke a strange sense of deja vu. A faint, almost imperceptible scent of perfume lingers in the air, mingling with the musty odor of the house. The soft, muffled crying from the room at the end of the hall sends chills down your spine.
        </p>  
        <p class="third-paragraphs">
            You can finally tell where the muffled noises are coming from - at the end of the hallway, there's a wooden door that's closed shut. You slowly creep up until you make your way to the door.
