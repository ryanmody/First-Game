            You climb the stairs, each step echoing ominously. The hallway is lined with family photos, their faces blurred and indistinct. There's a bathroom door ajar, revealing a dual set of toothbrushes and toiletries.

        <p class="second-paragraphs">
            The floorboards under the carpet creaks under your weight, and the faded wallpaper is marked with stains and scratches. The photos on the wall, though their details are obscured, evoke a strange sense of deja vu. A faint, almost imperceptible scent of perfume lingers in the air, mingling with the musty odor of the house. There's soft, muffled crying from the room at the end of the hall.
