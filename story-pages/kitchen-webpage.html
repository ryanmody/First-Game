            The kitchen is a scene of devastation. Broken plates and cutlery litter the floor, and the counters are piled high with rotting food and empty bottles. Cobwebs stretch across the corners of the ceiling, and flies buzz around the overflowing trash can. Each step you take crunches on shards of broken glass, amplifying the eerie silence.

        <p class="second-paragraphs">
         You step carefully, your eyes scanning for something useful - and you notice the kitchen knife set along the wall, with one knife missing. Just as you start to move closer, you hear a piercing screech behind you. You turn around, and see a ghostly figure, twisted - standing between you and the way back to the living room.

            Nearby, a hallway leads to different routes. To one side, stairs lead downwards to a locked door, probably leading to the basement. To the other side, another set of stairs in the corner winds upwards to the second floor, shrouded in darkness. Without a light source, it would be difficult to see anything up there, the shadows concealing whatever might be lurking in the rooms above.
