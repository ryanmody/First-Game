            The kitchen is a chaotic mess. Broken plates litter the floor, and the counters are piled high with rotting food and empty bottles. You search for something, anything, to defend yourself. and decayed, lunges at you, hurling glassware with inhuman force. The room reeks of spoiled food and spilled alcohol, a pungent mix that makes your stomach churn. The fridge door hangs open, revealing moldy leftovers and rancid milk.

         Cobwebs stretch across the corners of the ceiling, and flies buzz around the overflowing trash can. Each step you take crunches on shards of broken glass, amplifying the eerie silence. As you rummage through the drawers, you hear a piercing screech behind you. You turn around, and see a ghastly figure, twisted - standing between you and the way back to the living room.

            Nearby, a hallway leads to different routes. To one side, stairs lead downwards to a locked door, probably leading to the basement. To the other side, another set of stairs in the corner winds upwards to the second floor, shrouded in darkness. Without a light source, it would be difficult to see anything up there, the shadows concealing whatever might be lurking in the rooms above.
