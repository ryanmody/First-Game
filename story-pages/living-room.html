            As you step into the living room, the atmosphere hits you like a physical blow. The space is dimly lit, with heavy curtains drawn tight against the windows, blocking out the daylight as if to keep the world at bay. The air is thick with the stale odor of cigarette smoke and the sour scent of spilled alcohol, mingling with the faint, musty aroma of neglected furniture.

            The room itself is a disordered collage of conflicting lives. A large, threadbare couch dominates the center, its cushions sagging and stained from years of use. Scattered across it are empty bottles of whiskey, some toppled over, others standing like silent sentinels to the countless nights of heavy drinking. The coffee table in front of the couch is a battlefield of its own, covered in overflowing ashtrays, half-eaten takeout containers, and a scatter of detective novels and case files, their pages marked by greasy fingerprints and splashes of liquor.

            Nearby, a hallway leads to different routes. To one side, stairs lead downwards to a locked door, probably leading to the basement. To the other side, another set of stairs in the corner winds upwards to the second floor, shrouded in darkness. Without a light source, it would be difficult to see anything up there, the shadows concealing whatever might be lurking in the rooms above.
