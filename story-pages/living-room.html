            You step into the living room, still nursing your injuries. The furniture is overturned, and the walls bear dark, violent stains. Broken picture frames litter the floor, their glass shards reflecting the chaos. The air is thick with the scent of spilled alcohol and something metallic â€” blood, maybe. The remnants of an intense struggle are everywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="second-paragraphs">
            The room is a minefield of memories, each object a painful reminder of what has transpired. The worn-out couch, the shattered lamp, the books and knick-knacks scattered like the debris of a broken life. God, this place shouldn't have been left to rot. 
        </p>

            Focus. You need a weapon this time. Something sharp.
